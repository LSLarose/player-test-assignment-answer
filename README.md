# player-test-assignment-answer
This repository was created to answer an internship's technical interview assignment.

# rationale
This program was written in go, as I understood that the internship would use golang and used it before
Upon further investigation, it was found to offer the researched caracteristics out of the box, that is:
- it offered automatic documentation for developpers with the 'godoc' tool
- it offered out of the box unit-testing capabilities
- golang comes preinstalled on docker containers, which is where it would be expected to be deployed(see: https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-golang/)

Assumptions:
 - This tool's final environment would be the cloud
